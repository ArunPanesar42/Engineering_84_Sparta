## Questions 
## Buisness Week 
- Q: What is DevOps?
- A: The term DevOps was formed by combining the words “development” and “operations”. It is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.  


- Q: What is the benifit of using DevOps?
- A: There are many benifits to using DevOps. The Techinical Benefits include continuous software delivery and faster resolution to problems. 


- Q: What is Agile and benefit of implementing it?
- A: Agile is a method of developing software solutions, including websites, web applications, and mobile applications, that focuses on delivering high-quality working software frequently and consistently, while minimizing project overhead and increasing business value. 


- Q: Why Sparta?
- A: I have been looking at Sparta Global from when it when it was in its start up and had only 100+ employees, now spartsa has over 500+ so i want to be apart of such a rapid developing company.


- Q: What is SCRUM?
- A: Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.


- Q: What is the benefit of implementing SCRUM?
- A: The benefits of scrum include, Increased ability to manage changing priorities, 
better visibility into projects, More alignment between business and IT


- Q: Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time?
- A: My long-term aspiration is to work for a leading technology or an innovative video game company due to my interest in computing and gaming. 
# WEEK 2
## SQL Week

- Q: What is a Join in SQL ?
- A: A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. The different joins are "INNER JOIN" which returns records that have matching values in both tables. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. 

- Q: What is a Primary Key and Foreign Key? What are their Functions?
- A: The Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in the table, some of the constraints include, primary key being unique, must always have an entry and the value must never change. Natural relationships exist between tables in most database structures, foreign keys are used to create solid relationships.Foreign keys ensures that the row of information in Table A corresponds to the correct information in Table B. 
 
- Q: What is DML and DDL?
- A:DML is Data Manipulation Language and inludes the functions SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE and DELETE. DDL is Data Definition Language and includes the function CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.

- Q: What is Normalisation ?
- A:Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Some of the normal forms include 1st Normal Form (Each table cell should contain a single value and Each record needs to be unique.), 
- 2nd Normal Form 
Rule 1- Be in 1NF 
Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key 
-3rd Normal Form  
Rule 1- Be in 2NF 
Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies 
 
- Q: What is the importance of an Entity Relationship Diagram?
- A:Entity Relationship diagram visually shows the various entities (tables) and relationship between entities ie, how two tables are inter-related and their cardinality. eg, one to one , one to many or many to many.
# WEEK 3
## GIT and GIT-HUB Questions and Answers 
- Q: What is GIT?
- A: GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.


- Q: Where does GIT-HUB store files?
- A: Git-hub stores files on the cloud for its users 

- Q: What is GIT Bash?
- A: Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. 
Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands. 
Bash is a popular default shell on Linux and macOS. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.

# WEEK 4  
## Python Questions and Answers 

- Q: What is OOP and Why should we use it?
- A: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. We should use it because of DRY(DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF), it keeps programmers from re-using their code and making objects more modular. 

- Q: OOP benefits and best use cases?
- A: 
- 1. Re-usability
It means reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. This is done with the use of a class. We can use it ‘n’ number of times as per our need.
- 2. Data Redundancy
This is a condition created at the place of data storage (you can say Databases)where the same piece of data is held in two separate places. So the data redundancy is one of the greatest advantages of OOP. If a user wants a similar functionality in multiple classes he/she can go ahead by writing common class definitions for the similar functionalities and inherit them.
- 3. Code Maintenance
This feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into it.
- 4. Design Benefits
If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and fixing things easily and eliminating the risks (if any). Here the Object Oriented Programs forces the designers to have a longer and extensive design phase, which results in better designs and fewer flaws. After a time when the program has reached some critical limits, it is easier to program all the non-OOP’s one separately.
- 5. Better productivity
with the above-mentioned facts of using the application definitely enhances its users overall productivity. This leads to more work done, finish a better program, having more inbuilt features and easier to read, write and maintain. An OOP programmer cans stitch new software objects to make completely new programs. A good number of libraries with useful functions in abundance make it possible.

- Q: What are four pillars of OOP and why should we use them?
- A:
- Abstraction - Abstraction is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information. For example to open your TV we only have a power button, It is not required to understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in TV remote control.
- Encapsulation - Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method) together into a single unit i.e. class. Encapsulation automatically achieve the concept of data hiding providing security to data by making the variable as private and expose the property to access the private data which would be public.
- Inheritance - The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritance is when an object acquires the property of another object. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behavior of another class (super-class). It helps to reuse, customize and enhance the existing code. So it helps to write a code accurately and reduce the development time.
- Polymorphism - It is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. or we can say that object can behave in different forms is call Polymorphism.

- Q: What is an API and Why should we use it
- A: API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
- 
- Q: What is pip?
- A: pip is the standard package manager for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library.
